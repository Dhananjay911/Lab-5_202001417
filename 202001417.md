# Lab-5_202001417

***Introduction:***

Pylint is the Python tool utilised for this lab. A Python code inspection tool called Pylint scans the code for mistakes, potential problems, and coding conventions. Developers frequently utilise it to enhance the quality and maintainability of their code. Pylint performs an analysis of the code and generates comprehensive reports on the style, complexity, and potential problems of the code. To further customise the analysis process, the application also enables user-created rules and plugins. Pylint's reports enable developers to find potential issues early in the development cycle and improve the code's efficiency, dependability, and maintainability. Overall, Pylint is a crucial tool for Python programmers who wish to preserve coding standards and ensure the quality of their code.
